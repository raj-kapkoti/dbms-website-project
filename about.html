         <h2>Our Mission</h2><br>
   FactDec is designed for everyone, emphasizing accessibility, performance, security, and ease of use.<br>
         We believe great website should work with minimum set up, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely. <br>The basic FactDec page is simple and predictable so you can easily get started. It also offers powerful features for growth and success.
<br><br>
We believe in democratizing publishing and the freedoms that come with open source.<br> Supporting this idea is a large community of people collaborating on and contributing to this project. The FactDec community is welcoming and inclusive. Our contributorsâ€™ passion drives the success of FactDec which, in turn, helps you reach your goals.<br><br>


FactDec contributors work around the globe, and have dedicated countless hours to build a tool that democratizes publishing. FactDec is open source that is both free and priceless.<br><br>
